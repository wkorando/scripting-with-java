## Try it yourself!

The code in this repo uses Java 16 syntax, so at least that version or later is required to be installed. Instructions below and also recommendations on how  to use multiple Java versions. 

1. Download the Java 16 JDK: https://jdk.java.net/16

2. Install and configure Java 16 as your default runtime.

	**Note:** It is recommended to use a utility that allows for the easy switching of JDK versions, such as [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/) or [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/)).
